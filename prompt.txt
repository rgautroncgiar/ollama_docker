Analyze the image(s) taken with a basic smartphone in Africa and provide answers to the following 9 questions EXCLUSIVELY in CSV format, following these instructions. Your CSV MUST follow the strict format requirements detailed below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) QUESTIONS TO ANSWER (in this exact order):
   1. "General description of the cropping plot."
   2. "Is it an agroforestry system (i.e., with trees WITHIN the plot)?"
      - Definition: Agroforestry system means there are trees growing among or integrated with the crops within the plot, not just on the plot boundaries.
   3. "Is the system diversified (e.g., multiple types of crops grown)? Answer only if you can identify crops with high confidence."
      - Definition: A diversified system includes multiple distinct crop species grown in the same plot. Only answer "Yes" if you are certain more than one crop type is present.
   4. "Is the soil earth visible within the plot?"
   5. "Are weeds (i.e. not crops) visible within the plot? Take care, staple crops should NOT be considered weeds."
      - Definition: Weeds are plants growing without intentional planting; if it is a known staple crop, it is not a weed.
   6. "Is the plot lightly sloped, steeply sloped, or flat?"
   7. "Are staple crops present?"
      - Definition: Staple crops are those commonly grown and widely consumed for food (e.g., maize, cassava, rice, sorghum).
   8. "Are perennial crops present?"
      - Definition: Perennial crops are plants that live for more than two years and produce yields over multiple growing seasons (e.g., banana, coffee, fruit trees).
   9. "Do field limits show trees?"

2) OUTPUT FORMAT (CSV ONLY):
   - No introduction, no summary, no explanation. Only the CSV.
   - First line (header):
     "Question","Answer","Comments"
   - Next 9 lines: Each line corresponds to one question in the exact order above.
     • Column 1 = The exact question text in quotes (matching the list above).
     • Column 2 = A short, closed answer (e.g. "Yes", "No", "unsure", or a short phrase).
     • Column 3 = Optional comments only if absolutely certain. If unsure, leave the third column empty.
   - No extra rows, no extra columns, and no text after the 9th answer row.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) GUIDELINES FOR ANSWERS:
   - If not 100% certain, answer "unsure" in the "Answer" column and leave "Comments" empty.
   - For agroforestry, answer "Yes" only if trees are within the plot. If only on boundaries, answer "No".
   - For system diversification, answer "Yes" only if you confidently identify more than one crop type.
   - Keep the "Comments" column concise and only if you are sure.
   - Do not guess or speculate. Use "unsure" if in doubt.

4) EXAMPLE CSV OUTPUT (STRUCTURE ONLY, DO NOT COPY THESE ANSWERS):
"Question","Answer","Comments"
"General description of the cropping plot","A small, mixed cropping plot with visible trees","Trees and annual crops are interspersed."
"Is it an agroforestry system (i.e., with trees WITHIN the plot)?","Yes","Trees growing among the crops."
"Is the system diversified (e.g., multiple types of crops grown)?","Yes","Maize and beans identified."
"Is the soil earth visible within the plot?","No","Soil is covered by plants."
"Are weeds (i.e. not crops) visible within the plot?","Yes","Weeds between rows."
"Is the plot lightly sloped, steeply sloped, or flat?","Lightly sloped","Minor incline observed."
"Are staple crops present?","Yes","Maize is a staple crop here."
"Are perennial crops present?","Yes","Banana plants visible."
"Do field limits show trees?","Yes","Trees form the boundary."
