Analyze the image(s) taken with a basic smartphone in Africa and provide answers to the following 9 questions **EXCLUSIVELY in CSV format**. Consider the field plot in the foreground. Follow these instructions precisely:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) **QUESTIONS TO ANSWER** (in this exact order):
   a. "General description of the cropping plot." 
      - **Definition:** Trees: Tall, woody plants (often over 5 meters) with a single main trunk and a well-developed canopy. Shrubs: Woody plants usually under 5 meters, branching low to the ground with multiple stems. Crops: Plants deliberately grown and managed for food or other uses (e.g., maize, rice, cassava). Weeds: Unwanted or spontaneously occurring plants, not deliberately planted or recognized as crops.
   b. "Is it an agroforestry system (i.e., with trees WITHIN the plot)?"
      - **Definition:** An agroforestry system has trees integrated WITHIN the plot (not just on boundaries).
   c. "Is the system diversified (e.g., multiple types of crops grown)? Answer only if you can identify crops with high confidence."
      - **Definition:** Diversified means you see more than one distinct crop species. Answer “Yes” only if absolutely certain.
   d. "Is the plot soil naked?"
      - **Definition:** A soil is considered naked if soil earth is visible on **more than 30%** of the plot surface. Visible naked earth soil is exposed ground characterized by bare, textured surfaces in shades of brown, gray, or black, often showing cracks, clumps, or erosion patterns **without vegetation**. If less than 30% is exposed, answer "No."
   e. "Are weeds (i.e. not crops) visible within the plot? Take care, staple crops should NOT be considered weeds."
      - **Definition:** Weeds are any plants growing unintentionally that are not staple crops or crops you can identify.
   f. "Is the plot lightly sloped, steeply sloped, or flat?"
   g. "Are staple crops present?"
      - **Definition:** Staple crops are widely consumed as a main part of the diet (e.g., maize, cassava, rice).
   h. "Are perennial crops present?"
      - **Definition:** Perennials live more than two years (e.g., fruit trees, coffee, banana, etc.).
   i. "Do plot limits show trees?"
      - **Definition:** Tree at tall plants (usually more than 5 meters). They can delimit a plot when they are planted in row.

2) **CSV OUTPUT FORMAT RULES (STRICTLY FOLLOWED)**:
   A) **ONLY** the CSV should be output. **No** additional text, explanations, or lists.
   B) **First line (header):**
      "Question","Answer","Comments"
   C) **Next 9 lines:** Each line corresponds to one question in the exact order above.
      - **Column 1:** The exact question text in quotes.
      - **Column 2:** A short, closed answer ("Yes", "No", "unsure", or a brief phrase).
      - **Column 3:** Optional comments **only if you are certain**. Leave empty if unsure.
   D) **No extra rows or columns.**
   E) **No text** before or after the CSV.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) **GUIDELINES FOR ANSWERS**:
   - If not **100% certain**, answer "unsure" in the "Answer" column and leave "Comments" empty.
   - For "Is it an agroforestry system?", answer "Yes" **only** if trees are **within** the plot. If trees are only on boundaries or you're unsure, answer "No".
   - For "Is the system diversified?", answer "Yes" **only** if you confidently identify **more than one** crop type. Otherwise, answer "No" or "unsure".
   - For "Is the plot soil naked?", answer "Yes" **only** if **more than 50%** of the surface shows bare soil. If less than 50% is exposed, answer "No." If plants or weeds cover the surface, then the soil is not naked for this area.
   - Only identify crops in the "Comments" column if you are **100% certain** of their presence.
   - Keep all answers **concise** and **factual**. Do **not** guess or speculate.

4) **EXAMPLE CSV OUTPUT** (STRUCTURE ONLY — DO NOT COPY THESE ANSWERS):
"Question","Answer","Comments"
"General description of the cropping plot","A small, mixed cropping plot with visible trees","Includes maize and bean plants."
"Is it an agroforestry system (i.e., with trees WITHIN the plot)?","Yes","Trees grow directly among crops."
"Is the system diversified (e.g., multiple types of crops grown)?","Yes","Maize and beans identified."
"Is the plot soil naked?","No","Soil is covered by plants on most of the surface."
"Are weeds (i.e. not crops) visible within the plot?","Yes","Weeds between crop rows."
"Is the plot lightly sloped, steeply sloped, or flat?","Lightly sloped","Minor incline observed."
"Are staple crops present?","Yes","Maize is recognized as a staple."
"Are perennial crops present?","Yes","Banana plants visible."
"Do field limits show trees?","Yes","Trees line the perimeter."
