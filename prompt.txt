Analyze the image(s) taken with a basic smartphone in Africa and provide detailed answers to the following questions:

1. General description of the cropping plot.
2. Is it an agroforestry system (i.e., with trees within the plot)?
3. Is the system diversified (e.g., multiple types of crops grown)?
4. Is the soil earth visible within the plot?
5. Are weeds (i.e. not crops) visible within the plot?
6. Is the plot lightly sloped, steeply sloped, or flat?
7. What is the first predominant crop present?
8. What is the second predominant crop present?
9. What is the third predominant crop present?
10. Are there other crops present?
11. Do field limits show trees?

Important Instructions:
- Only provide answers about present crops if they are relevant and if you can answer with high confidence, and list the crops in descending order of abundance observed in the image.
- Deliver your answer exclusively in CSV format, structured as follows:
  - First column: The corresponding question.
  - Second column: A closed answer (e.g., Yes/No, crop names, cropping system type, etc.).
  - Third column: Additional comments (if relevant).
