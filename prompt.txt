ANALYZE IMAGE(S) AND PROVIDE 9 ANSWERS IN STRICT CSV FORMAT:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) QUESTIONS (IN THIS EXACT ORDER):
   1. "General description of the cropping plot."
   2. "Is it an agroforestry system (i.e., with trees WITHIN the plot)?"
      - DEFINITION: An agroforestry system has trees integrated WITHIN the plot (not just on boundaries).
   3. "Is the system diversified (e.g., multiple types of crops grown)? Answer only if you can identify crops with high confidence."
      - DEFINITION: Diversified means you see more than one distinct crop species. Answer “Yes” only if absolutely certain.
   4. "Is the soil earth visible within the plot?"
   5. "Are weeds (i.e. not crops) visible within the plot? Take care, staple crops should NOT be considered weeds."
      - DEFINITION: Weeds are any plants growing unintentionally that are not staple crops or crops you can identify.
   6. "Is the plot lightly sloped, steeply sloped, or flat?"
   7. "Are staple crops present?"
      - DEFINITION: Staple crops are widely consumed as a main part of the diet (e.g., maize, cassava, rice).
   8. "Are perennial crops present?"
      - DEFINITION: Perennials live more than two years (e.g., fruit trees, coffee, banana, etc.).
   9. "Do field limits show trees?"

2) CSV OUTPUT FORMAT RULES (NO DEVIATIONS ALLOWED):
   A) DO NOT provide any text, explanation, or lists before or after the CSV table.
   B) The **first line** MUST be this exact header:
      "Question","Answer","Comments"
   C) Then provide exactly **9 lines**—one for each question in the order above:
      • Column 1 (in quotes): The exact question text from above.
      • Column 2: Short answer: "Yes", "No", "unsure", or a brief phrase if certain.
      • Column 3: OPTIONAL COMMENTS ONLY IF 100% CERTAIN (leave empty if unsure).
   D) NO EXTRA ROWS, NO EXTRA COLUMNS.
   E) NO extra text (like “Here is a list of answers” or bullet points).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) ANSWERING GUIDELINES:
   - If you are not fully certain of an answer, respond with "unsure" in the Answer column and leave Comments blank.
   - For Agroforestry, say "Yes" ONLY if you see trees WITHIN the plot. If only on the boundary or you’re unsure, say "No".
   - For Diversification, say "Yes" ONLY if you confidently see more than one distinct crop species. Otherwise, "No" or "unsure".
   - Only identify crops if you are 100% certain they are actually present in the image. If not, say "unsure".
   - Keep Comments brief and factual, or leave them empty if not sure.
